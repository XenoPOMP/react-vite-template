# Chrome extension guide

## Setup

To convert this project to Chrome extension project, use this command in shell:

```yarn
rvt init chrome-extension
```

Visit [CLI docs](./CLI.md) to acknowledge more about CLI.

This command will prompt data about extension from you, then will auto-generate manifest.json (it will be located at ``./.rvt/manifests/chrome``).

Command will also correct your `package.json`\`s scripts.
